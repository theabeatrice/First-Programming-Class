# GenAI Comparison: After comparing my code with the GenAI output, I used "print()" instead of using print(" ") to indicate a blank line between two outputs, which saves me time.
# It also added the if __name__ == "__main__": guard to make it more sophisticated. This is a new term I have not learned yet, so I will need to research it further.
# GenAI Statement: My code and answers are not a production of GenAI.
